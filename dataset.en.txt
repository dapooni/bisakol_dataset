This recipe book is written in both English and Bisakol to promote the Bisakol language, spoken in Southern Sorsogon.
In this book, you will find the recipes in an easy side-by-side English and Bisakol layout. 
It is aimed both at people who are interested in the language, and also at people who want to taste some favorite dishes from the Philippines. 
Tamarind pork soup
Boil the water. Boil the tamarind for thirty minutes until soft.
Take the tamarind out of the water, dry it and peel it. 
Crush until the juice is extracted.
While boiling the water, saute the garlic and onion.
Add the pork and cook until slightly browned.
Add one liter of water, let it boil in the pot for forty-five minutes.
Put the tamarind juice in the boiling pork. 
Add the vegetables, starting with the taro first. Boil for ten to fifteen minutes.
Put in the chili, tomatoes, snake beans, okra and eggplant.
Put in salt, fish sauce and pepper.
Lastly, add the water spinach.
Remove from the fire as the vegetables will be cooked by the residual heat.
Whenever I come to Sydney, I bring two dozen packets of sinigang mix from the Philippines.
There are two flavors of sinigang mix - one just with tamarind, and one with tamarind and taro. I like the one with taro because it makes the soup stickier.
How to cook
Stingray with coconut milk
Boil the stingray until it is cooked.
Drain the stingray.
Strip the leaves of the moringa and chili from the stems.
Slice the onion, garlic, chili and ginger up finely.
Flake the flesh of the drained and dried stingray flesh. If desired, remove the skin.
Saute the ginger, then the onion and garlic.
Next, add the flaked stingray.
Add ground pepper, salt and one-fourth cup of vinegar.
Saute the mixture until it becomes dry.
Then, add 2 cups of coconut milk.
Stir until the mixture boils.
When the coconut milk boils, add the chili.
Add the moringa.
After it boils, add the chili leaves.
Top with chili.
Whenever I come home, there is always kinunot na pagi on the table because Mom knows that this is my favorite.
Beef and peanut stew
Heat the oil in a pan then sauté the garlic and onion.
Add pepper and mix.
Add the beef chunks until slightly browned.
Add the ground peanuts. (You can ground peanuts with a food processor until fine or use peanut butter).
Add beef broth and let boil. Add water if needed until the beef is soft. This takes around an hour.
When the broth begins to boil, cover the pot until the beef is soft.
While the beef is boiling, blanch the vegetables individually.
As soon as the vegetables are blanched, submerge them in ice and cold water then dry them.
Add fish sauce to the broth.
Mix the rice flour and annatto in half a cup of water. Add to the beef stew. (The more annatto you add the more vibrant the color will be).
Keep on heat until the stew thickens.
Plate the dish. Either mix the vegetables with the stew or have them separate.
Add prawn paste separately.
I did not eat Kare-kare before. My housemate taught me how to make it when I came to Australia.
"Alright, I’ll take the top end of the tree, cause that’s where the bananas grow", said the Tortoise.
"Oh! You can’t do that. I saw it first, the top end is mine’, said the Monkey.
They cut the banana tree.
The Monkey got the end part.
The Tortoise got his share too.
They went home and planted their parts in their backyards.
After a few days, what the Monkey planted had died.
But the Tortoise’s plant grew and bore fruit.
The Monkey came and cried.
"My tree died", said the Monkey.
The Tortoise was sad as well.
It doesn’t know how to climb the tree.
"Don’t be sad", said the monkey.
"I’ll climb the tree and when I reach the top, I'll throw you some ripe bananas."
The Monkey climbed the tree.
But when it reached the top, it ate all the bananas, and didn’t give any to the Tortoise.
The Tortoise got mad.
So the Tortoise put thorns all around the tree.
When the Monkey climbed down, it felt the pain.
"Ouch!", shouted the monkey.

My name is Sophie De La Rosa. I live in Barangay Bonifacio in Bulan.
I will tell you what I do everyday.
Maybe we both do the same thing. Come! We will learn about my life and our place.
I wake up at four am in the morning. When I wake up I feed the chickens, pigs and goats.
Mum cooks breakfast while I feed the animals. The usual food we eat in the mornings is fried rice and dried fish.
When I walk to school, I have to walk through the rice fields to get to the road. 
I don’t wear my shoes until I reach the road so they don’t wear out.
It takes about an hour to walk to school. My other classmates ride the tricycle because it’s faster.
Maam taught us about Philippine history using Bisakol.
My teacher said the Spaniards came to the Philippines in 1521.
They were initially looking for spices. And they eventually liked the country, so they conquered us. They stayed in the Philippines for 333 years.
So Filipinos learned Spanish. Even here in Bulan, we have a lot of words adopted from Spanish.
Our break is from twelve to one. I don’t go home during lunch because our house is too far. 
My classmates ride the tricycle home.
My usual packed lunch is rice and sardines.
After lunch, I have class until four in the afternoon.
After class, I walk home to help mum and dad pack the rice which they dried for the whole day.
At 7pm, my family comes together to eat dinner at the dinner table.
Rice and vegetable or fish is our usual dinner.
After dinner, I do my assignments and watch TV with my family.
At 9pm, I brush my teeth and go to sleep.
Thanks for sharing my day with me. Bye!
My father ran for municipal councilor.
It is expensive to study in Manila.
I will give my mother some money.
Just give her the allowance.

“Grrrah,” The crocodile groaned.
“Hush now, the food will come by soon, then we will both have something to eat.” The aswang said lovingly to her pet.
Prey was hard to come by these days, the humans knew that this place in the swamp was the hunting ground for the aswang and her pet, but that wasn’t about to stop her from finding a meal.
“We just have to go closer to the village, and then everything will be better,” The crocodile grunted again and the aswang reassured him. 
“I know, we’ll find some children, I know how much you like the taste of those.”
The crocodile wagged its tail with joy; it had not had that treat in many months.
“Yes, let’s go nearer to the village and set a trap. We can catch the ones swimming by the river!”, the aswang walked alongside her pet to the riverbank.
She was hungry, and so was her pet. Due to the human’s caution, food was hard to find. 
The last meal they both had was a fisherman that strayed too far into the swamp. He was stringy and tough, not a dinner that either of them savored.
The aswang was all smiles though. She knew that prey would be plentiful. 
She had always relied on the strength of her pet to catch their meals, she was not like the other aswang who would fly around the village terrorizing the humans.
She was an agalon hayopan, a kind of aswang that would raise crocodiles to hunt their prey for them. 
The other aswang would often jeer and call their kind lazy, but they would never know the hardship one would take just to raise a single crocodile from an egg.
The crocodile grumbled again and she laughed. They spent years together and she had raised this one ever since he was a hatchling. 
She knew his quirks and quips just as well as he knew hers.They were inseparable. She knew that once he had something to eat, he would change back to his lazy self.
“We’re here,” The aswang and her pet stood by the river.
“Time to get some food.”
“Grrrah,” replied her pet.

“Mama, she’s doing it again,” Justo says as he pulls his mother’s dress.
“It’s okay child just leave her alone. Now help me with breakfast, we have to go to the market,” his mother replies.
“But it’s so early in the morning! I want to sleep more,” protests Justo.
“We both want to sleep more, but if we don’t go to the market there will be no breakfast. Now come along, I’ll make your favorite.”
“Longganisa?!** Ok mama! Let’s go!”
Justo prepares himself for the trip to the market and in the back of his mind he asks, “Why is ate*** like that? All she does is stare outside the window.”
It wasn’t always like that. Justo could remember to the times he wasn’t able to talk and the beautiful serenade of his sister’s voice. 
He liked the way she would hold him up, as if she was lifting him to the heavens so he could see the entire world.
Those days were gone and he didn’t know why. 
One night, he heard the soft weeping of his mother from his room and he saw his sister standing by the window side, 
her eyes glazed.
That wasn’t all that happened. He remembered that his mother told him to stay in his room, no matter what may happen. 
She locked all the doors and closed the windows and made sure that everyone in the house was where they were supposed to be.
There was a faint sound of something he couldn’t make out. Justo couldn’t keep his curiosity hidden so he pressed his ear against the door to his room and waited.
There was a scream from his sister and a shout from his mother.
And then, silence.
His mother wouldn’t admit that anything was wrong. She would dress up his sister every morning and leave her by the window.
And still, Justo didn’t know why.
What happened to his sister? Why was she like that?
“Mama I’m ready!” Justo was dressed for the rain. He brought his lucky umbrella along to make sure they both would stay dry.
“Oh what a handsome boy! Now come with me, let’s be fast so we can get back early so you can get ready for school.”
“Okay mama.”
Justo couldn’t help but glance at his sister as they left the house. Her eyes locked on something Justo couldn’t see.
Justo always loved the wet market. There were so many things to see and smell. He liked going by the fish vendors and poking the fish in their eyeballs. He had seen older people do this and he thought it was their way of testing if the fish was really fish.
While his mother was haggling over some eggs for their breakfast, Justo had a look around the market. 
The vegetables were especially bright today and he spent his time poking some sayote to see if they were fresh.
The vegetable vendor didn’t look particularly amused at the young boy’s playing with his produce and Justo was wondering why he hadn’t been shooed away yet. 
Usually it would take a few minutes before the vendors realized he wasn’t going to buy anything and they would tell him to go somewhere else.
It was then that Justo realized that the people in the market were looking at him and his mother strangely. 
They would give a glance and mumble something to their companions before walking away.
“Justo, come here!” his mother called from across the market.
“Coming mama!” Justo ran to his mother’s side, he wanted to go home. Now, he could feel the stares pulling him in different directions.
After his mother paid for the eggs, Justo whispered, “Mama why are people looking at us funny?”
“Don’t pay them any mind. That’s just how some people are,” his mother said with a hint of uncertainty.
But Justo perked his ears and tried to make out what some of them were saying. He could only hear one word, repeated.
“Atros.”
It was the same day in and day out. Justo’s ate would be dressed by their mother and she would sit by the window, unresponsive to anything. 
One time, Justo threw a ball at her head and she didn’t even flinch.
Every day he would ask his mother what happened and every day she would change the subject.
One day enough was enough.
Justo’s mother was busy washing the dishes when he blurted out,
“Mama, what’s an Atros?”
The kitchen echoes with the sound of the breaking plate.
“Where did you hear that, anak?”
“It was just…. Some people in the market were talking about it when they were looking at us.”
“Don’t listen to them anak, they don’t know what they’re talking about.”
“But what is it mama? Does it have something to do with ate?”
“You have to get ready for school don’t you? Come on, get dressed.”
“I’m already dressed mama. Please, tell me. Maybe we can help ate.”
Justo couldn’t tell you how long the moment lasted, but it seemed like five forevers. His mother and he had their gazes locked, both not backing down to the other’s will.
Finally, his mother broke the stalemate.
“It’s time for you to go to school.”
“But mama—-”
“No other words, you have to go to school now.”
“Mama—-”
“No. And don’t ask about this ever again.”
It was the middle of the night when Justo heard something strange from outside his window. It was like the beating of drums.
Justo wondered if it was a parade, but what kind of parade would happen in the middle of the night.
Fueled by curiosity he unlocked the front door and peered outside.
He saw a group of people, though they were very short. They had fair skin, eyes that bulged and big pot bellies. They were riding what looked like horses and the sound of beating drums followed them where they went.
Justo was just about to open the door when someone grabbed him and put their hand over his mouth.
He didn’t have time to react and the mystery figure pushed them both to the ground holding Justo down until the sound of the drums faded.
“Mama!” Justo exclaimed after he saw who it was that pushed down. “What are they?”
His mother was in tears. “I won’t lose another one to those things. I won’t.” Justo managed to pick up through her sobs.
“Mama,” Justo said, “Please. Tell me what happened. What are those things? Do they have anything to do with ate?”
“I was just trying to be a good mother. I heard the drums and I knew the legends. I know what they take.”
“What did they take mama?”
“They took her soul.”
Ever since that night, Justo never trusted the new moon. He saw it as a symbol of loss and pain.
Because every day he would see his sister stare blankly out the window and he knew.
She could never get back what was taken from her.
And it was a curse, knowing what happened, for he couldn’t do anything about it, except watch and wait. For the coming of a new moon.
To see the monsters that took his sister from him.
“I can make it in two minutes. It’s only a few feet to the next building and I can run fast.” 
You can feel your heartbeat reverberate to your feet, your hands are cold and sweaty and the chill down your spine has been there for the better part of an hour. 
The muscles in your legs start to tighten and you take one deep breath before starting your sprint.
“This might be the last breath I’ll ever take.” The adrenaline surges through your body. Each step makes you feel like you’re the fastest person in the world. 
Your face betrays a smile, “This is it!” you think, “I made it!” Your objective is just a few steps away.
“Oh no.” You don’t know how it got there so fast. You were so sure that you were going to outrun it. The woman stares at you with her bulging red eyes and her hideous face twists in a scream. 
“No!” The voice in your head shouts “It wasn’t supposed to be this way!”
Your legs take you in the opposite direction, back to the relative safety of the tree. “Why didn’t I stay indoors?” The decisions all start coming back to haunt you 
“Why didn’t I take up running?”, “Why am I in this place?”, “Why didn’t I listen when I had the chance.” The voices in your head won’t stop screaming.
The tree is in sight now. “It won’t be able to get past the branches.” You realize it’s been less than five minutes since you started running. 
Less than five minutes would make the difference between now and the rest of your life.
“One more step and I’m there.” Just one last dash and it won’t be able to grab you. There is a moment of doubt before you lunge under the tree and crash into the roots. 
You don’t feel much of the pain because of your adrenaline. “I’m still alive.” You’ve never been more grateful.
Until you put your hand to your chest. “No, no, no…” Your mind trails off. “It couldn’t have been that fast.” 
The blood starts to trickle down your fingers onto the rest of your clothes. “I made it, I’m supposed to be safe.”
You repeat those words in your head until there’s too much blood loss. “I should be safe.” Was what you thought before you closed your eyes, maybe for the last time.
Why should you fear death?
Let me tell you a story.
A long time ago, there was a rich woman who lived by the sea. She would not have any visitors, for she liked the quiet that her large house gave her. 
She would spend her days and nights by the beach, counting each star and each grain of sand.
She had but one friend, not like any person in the world, for it was not a person at all. The shadow of death would spend time with her to ease her loneliness. 
They first met when death’s shadow claimed the woman’s mother. She was not afraid as most people would have been and greeted the shadow politely.
“Why are you not running in fear?” The shadow asked. “You are part of what makes life beautiful.” The woman answered.
Death’s shadow had never been called beautiful before and it stayed until the woman finished the larao, the ritual ceremony to protect her mother’s body from those that would harm it after death. The shadow fell in love with the woman then, for it had never met a human who respected death such as she did.
Death’s shadow was a jealous thing and it wanted the woman all to itself. It had followed her to the seaside and had planned to drown the woman, so that she may be in death’s embrace forever.
The woman was no fool, though and knew what the shadow had planned. She left her house and visited her grandmother. 
For you see, the old woman had great power that was once rejected by her granddaughter. The woman had no choice, death’s shadow was approaching. 
When the shadow caught up to the woman it was surprised. She had become deathless, she would never know the shadow’s embrace.
The woman would not leave death’s shadow though. She had known the betrayal of a trusted friend, and she would not rest until she had her revenge. 
Every time death was not respected through the larao, she would be there. Desecrating what would have been the shadow’s prize.
You should not fear death.
Fear what comes after.
“You there please go away..”
“Now say it with me.”
“Kayu-kayu, madayu kayu.”
“Good. Now remember, we always have to say that whenever we pass this place.”
“We also can’t sweep here right mama?”
“Yes, it’s good you remembered. I have such a smart boy!”
“But why do we have to follow these rules mama? I thought this was our house?”
“It is, it’s our place with all our things, but what is the house on?”
“….the ground?”
“Good job! Now the ground and all the earth, doesn’t belong to us.”
“But I thought this was our land? Isn’t this our farm? And isn’t this where I play?”
“Yes, yes, we bought this land, and we have all the papers to prove it, but then it gets complicated. 
See the land belonged to some other… people, long before we came here, before any humans started a town in this area.”
“But can’t we just buy it from those people?”
“There are just some things you can’t buy with money. This place is their home and always will be, long after you and I are gone. We have to learn to live with them.”
“What if I don’t want to? They seem mean. If we don’t say these things and if we just clean around our house we get sick. How is that fair?”
“How is it fair that they have to share their home with us?”
“…”
“It isn’t an ideal situation for either of us, but we have to learn to be kind to one another. If we are kind to them, they will be kind to us. Now what do we say?”
“Kayu-kayu, madayu kayu.”
“In the three days before the resurrection, the devil will make his way into the hearts of man. 
Be careful of the places you go and the things that you meet.”
I’m half asleep as I listen to the sermon. Mass hasn’t been the most exciting thing I’ve done today, but lola dragged me here. 
I wish I was back home in front of my computer doing something interesting. I could squeeze in a few games before the next mass I have to go to.
“The children of the devil walk the earth at this time, make no mistake, they will take forms that will entice you to help them. 
They hide under the shroud of innocence and they pervert what will be good. The product of a union with the devil will only bring pain and misery.”
The priest seems to really like talking. I’m still drifting in and out, thinking about anything else that will get me out of this place. 
The pews are hard, the aircon’s broken and everyone has the same look on their face: placid, but still listening.
“Remember this warning. In these three days the agents of the devil will come. 
I am reminded of a story where the devil had a union with another monster. 
This child of darkness seeks to devour the flesh of man and it screams will create more like it.”
This is strange. The priest is changing his voice. It seems a lot deeper now. I don’t know what he’s been talking about but it really seems to be affecting him.
“My mother was one of its victims. The price of one’s sin is sometimes too much to bear. 
But the Lord would never send agents of the Devil to do his work. The Lord will forgive, not destroy. 
Remember the light of love will be with you all.”
The priest is softly crying now. I wish I had paid more attention to the earlier part of the sermon. He seemed to be caught in a trance.
“The devil will seek to lead you astray and his child is no different. Always put your trust in the Lord. For only in Him will you find true salvation.”
The sermon ends with that. I’m still a bit shaken from the change that the priest had while he was saying it. I take a small detour to the park where I notice something strange.
It’s a baby. It seems to have been left alone, the poor thing. I go near it to see if I can help it find its parents. 
The words of the priest still echo in my ears, but I ignore them.
A baby can’t hurt me.
That's why I don't want to marry
someone who lives in the hills
Cause the climbing up and down
makes my knees sore
Moreover, you will be ordered
to grate coconuts
The grating motion
is a pain in the neck
Women when preparing

Comb their hair in the morning

But when they are already
married
Comb their hair in October
comb again next December.

Remember the flower.
In the morning it is beautiful,
But due to the extreme heat, 
It wilts in the afternoon.
Before one can reap,
He must first plant.
Of what use would the fodder be
If the horse is dead?
What you sow
Is what you reap.
A kind of tree
Will bear its kind of fruit.
From the latundan
Will not spring a bunguran.
A guava tree will not bring forth
A lemon fruit.
It is possible to pair off
A mature and a young coconut.
Pretending,
When in reality, really a banana.
It is a big tree,
But it casts not shade.
One that does not bark
Is prone to bite.
However big the stone is
It will be worn away by water drops.
It is the snail that must come to the stone.
For the stone will not come to the snail.
He who is afraid of locusts
Will not reap anything.
Don't expect a cat
To have horns.
Though it is covered well,
The fish will smell if it is rotten.
She took so much time choosing,
And what she found was a tabige.
He hitched  a ride on the carabao's back,
And now he wants to control its horns.
The one who crowed
Is the one who laid the egg.
The horse will not wince
If it has no wound.
The carabao was whipped,
The horse got stripes.
He derides, yet he's a skunk,
He contradicts, yet he's a monkey.
The sow will not mate
If she is not inclined.
Acting like a virgin
when she's really a pig.
If fed with chicken dung
Wipe it off because of its foul odor.
A fish
Is caught through its mouth.
The ground has ears,
The tongue has wings.
One word is enough
For the wise.
There is no beauty
That has no defect.
Suffer it, my heart,
No one asked you to do it.
If a maiden falls,
Though she may get up, she'll be scratched and bruised.
A father's mark
Is difficult to erase.
Blood will drip,
Where the meat is hung.
Beautiful of face,
her body is full of worms.
When her back is turned she looks like a Virgin,
Whe she turns around, she looks like a pig.
If he gets in his fist,
He'll get it in up to his elbow.
Where you are tethered,
There you will feed.
One who relies on other people
Will go hungry.
Company
Company
a festering sore.
He who treads heavily
Will hurt deeply.
If you are not sure of the distance,
If you jump, you will fall.
He who meddles
Is a suspect.
What's the cure for forgetfulness?
One vertical and one horizontal.
What's the cure for forgetfulness?
A blow to the head.
Where you fell, 
There you must rise.
You're a friend when you have 
You're an enemy when you have none
After she gave it, she took it back,
The whore has skin disease.
Derider
Because guilty.
One who pretends to be asleep
Is difficult to waken.
One who pretends to help,
But is actually a thief.
Saint, little saint,
With an evil heart.
Playing dead,
But actually a thief.
Pretending to be demure
But really a loose woman.
Hele-hele
But actually likes it.
Pretending to be religous,
But really a wanton saint.
When one denies without being asked,
It means he is guilty of misconduct.
Don't brag about your strength
Because you might trip and fall.
He who does not listen to his parents
Doesn't turn out well.
He who does not listen to advice
Encounters hard times.
Better to make a child cry when he is a baby,
Than for him to make his parents cry when he grows up.
Eat what is 
Don't seek for what is not there.
Don't depend on what is not there,
Even food is lost on its way to the mouth.
Breakfast is to warm the stomach,
Not for indulging.
Coward, coward,
Brave enough only to confront the porridge.
I pounded the rice, I cooked it,
When cooked, someon else ate it.
No one will melt
His own salt.
where the sweet is, 
There the ant is also.
If there is abundance,
There is scarcity.
Waste your resources,
When they run out, there is hunger.
Jest with drunken man,
But not with one who has just fallen asleep.
The size of the button
Is also the size of the buttonhole.
Were it not for the fiesta in Sipocot,
She wouldn't be darning her clothes.
If you have a short blanket
Curl up your body.
The one who holds the bag
Should not dip his hand in it.
The can that gives off a loud noise
Is usually empty.
It is easy to break a coconut midrib
When it is just one piece.
If you laid away something
You'll have something.
Where are you going to grab support,
On post or on a weed?
The one who is near the pot
Is the one who gets the soot.
Far from the fire,
And yet pushed in.
He sees the needle's eye
But not that of the axe.
The house was locked
After the thief left.
The house was propped
After the storm.
The barn was closed
After the horse had escaped.
Aready sleeping on the bed,
He transferred to the floor.
One who is misled
Ends up in the sea.
The rain may miss the ground when it falls,
But a mother's word is always true.
Before the sun rises
One can already discern its light
There is no shore
That does not have an opposite shore.
If you are afraid to ford a stream,
You won't be able to ford a river.
Inquire of those you pass on the road,
So you don't lose your way.
However long the procession is,
It will still end up in church.
Where there is devotion,
There is temptation.
Hail Mary, most pure,
Sinless if coming with a gift,
If not, get out.
He who accepts suffering
Is a child of God.
The parish priest for the funeral,
The coadjutor for the dying.
What was started in play
Has become a finished basket.
Where does plenty begin
But in small amounts.
Bad news
Spreads quickly.
There is no inferior pen
To the one who writes well.
It isn't written yet,
But already it is being read.
The word that has been uttered
Cannot be unsaid.
Whatever the music 
So the dance shall be.
Today, let’s learn a little Southern Sorsoganon Bisakol
Do you know where the Southern Sorsoganon speakers live?
Here’s the map
Good morning!
Good afternoon!
Good night!
What’s your name?
My name is Mar Marvenn
Where are you going?
Have you eaten yet?
Where do you live?
How old are you?
Who are your parents?
Do you want to eat?
What do you want Chef Rafi to cook?
Please help me. I’m lost.
Please help me. I’m dizzy.
Don’t leave me!
I want to buy that. How much is it? 
I’m very hungry. Is there a place to eat nearby?
Yes. No. 
Goodbye!
It doesn't matter that we perish,
As long as we're piled on top of each other.
Money already on the boat,
and it still became stone.
Don't brag about your wealth
For even the spring dries up.
Asked a proper question,
He gives a mean answer.
There is no debt
That is not repaid.
A debt of gratitude
Cannot be repaid.
Regret
Always comes at the end.
He who commits his word,
Commits to honor it.
There are no limits
For revenge.
No one was ever born
Alone in this world.
Life and Fate,
Even if you desire to, you can't change it.
Even if times change,
And the world is turned upside down,
It's all the same,
What is up must go down.
The meek
Is far from danger.
The man for outside tasks,
The woman for the house.
We only appreciate what is good
When it is gone.
Coming from a split bamboo or a hole
Waiting for the rice to come to the chicken
Naturally she will follow in the footsteps of the mother sow
He can string together a cat's bristles
Hot enough to broil a fish
More slippery than an eel
The banguran has ripened.
Wearing his tail like a g-string 
Tail between his legs
He played with a turtle
When the crow turns white
Being handled like an egg
Snakes can nest in it
Making like a turtle
Blood boils
Blood will drain
Heavy buttocks
Saliva dried up
Grew a beard waiting
The flies swarmed all over him
His spit dried up
The black of his eyes turned white
Eyes were like fish eyes
A long upper lip
A shiny upper lip
Ears became so big and wide
Eavesdropper
Got a mole on his feet
Work done by the feet
The ear wax fell off
The ears were cleaned
Has zipper on the tummy
Using mouth to look for something
A very long tongue
A tongue that has branches
A forked tongue
A tongue that can cause festering sore
Several tongues
At the tip of the tongue
Salivating with pleasure
Having a long hand
His footmark goes dry
There's someone under the house
The liver will be turned inside out
Can crinkle up the heart
Still having a running nose
Washed his hands
You can't walk in front of him
You can't walk in front of him
You can't walk in front of him
You can't out-step him
You cut off his step 
Gentle but with pressure
No shirring on the buttocks
Taking very small steps
Though you feed him with chicken dungPut a roof over your salt
Put a roof over your salt
One hen scratch, one mouthful
Though you feed him from the palm of your hand
Eating rice and salt
Pressing salt between thumb and forefinger
Eating copra with your rice
Expands like gruel
He's got deep pockets
Lifting his own bench
You want to be rocked in a hammock
sitting together like the stone tripod
Sleeping at the ash stove
Prepare to feed the stairs
The spoon and eel have met
As long as he has enough energy to pull up his blanket
Made of high-grade steel
Being chased by a pair of scissors
Already curled up in a basket
License has already expired
He has stowed away in his trunk
We don't need any light tonight
Caused a chair bottom to give way
He's got a long rope
The post of the town
The wire snapped
Missing a screw
Missing a screw
Swimming in ankle-deep water
Not exposing it to the wind
Holding up the sky
Set fire to the high seas
The heavens may go wrong
The rain may miss the ground  
Very windy
Beyond the reach of thunder
Harder than stone
Lightning might strike you
The moon is full
He's fueled up
He's fueled up
Through you have a priest for a brother
Let the bells ring
Though you have the Christ on your breast
Though you order a Mass from a harelip carabao
When the world ends
The devil might push you off
Has a short cord
Playing around
Paper is already wet
Of the ten words he speaks, eleven are lies
The town's newspaper
Trying to obtain a wider piece of paper
Feel it, it is very hairy.
Open it, it is very red.
Achuete
When you forget it,
You take it with you;
When you remember it,
You leave it behind

Shorter than ten-cent piece lying on its face
Lying on a pile of money

From the barrio of Suwa
Luck has forgotten
Like the flower of the road
Like a forest

The bell fell
Threw the town into an uproar
Poop
Why does the pig stay longer under the place
Where a man is moving his poop?
It thinks that there are more droppings coming
What distinguishes the feces of a woman 
from the feces of a man?
That of a woman is wet,
that of the man is dry
Two siblings 
Are on either side of the mountain
Eyes
Two stores
Are opened simultaneously
Eyes
Two balls of thread 
Are able to reach the sky
Eyes
What part of the body 
is always wet? 
Is borded by hair?
Eyes
I chop and chop
No sound is heard
Winking
You’re still here
You’re already then 
Sight or thought
The one who lost was glad
The one who found it was sad
Fart
What is the wind 
That is foul
What foul-smelling thing can a fly not alight on
Fart
Between two mountains
There is a priest that groans
Fart
A very high mountain
Cannot be seen
Forehead
When standing
It dangles
When sitting
It settles limply
Scrotum
Two coconuts
One Sprout
Male genitals
You have 
You haven’t counted
Hair
Angry
But grinning
Harelip
Which man has the biggest hat?
The one with the biggest head
I don't want to marry someone who lives up in the hills
The trudging and climbing makes my knees sore
Moreover, you will be ordered to grate coconuts
The rocking motion is a pain in the neck
There upriver was a young widow
She bought a rosary so she could pray
But when two bachelors passed by her
She let go of the beads and hied off to get engaged
Kilikilitatis
Kilikilitasyon
The male servant of the priest was tasked to carry the umbrella
When the umbrella made of paper was finally torn
He was made to pay for it, the poor slave
Ilon, ilon Nanding karamay
For example, the petite young woman
She had her hair curled and her eyebrows shaved
She was slender, but she had mighty big legs
Oh, this Neneng wanted to follow the fashion
She wore a tight-fitting skirt, she put on a kimono
She even dabbed herself with Eclat powder
What a funny thing-she was reeking of urine
Over there where I live was a young woman
She peed on sunday; but it was only Monday when it began to drip
Another Sunday is coming
She has not yet let go of the dipper in her hand
Women, when they prepare for  marriage
Comb their hair in the morning and again in the afternoon
But when they are already married
They comb their hand in October and comb it next in December
That is why I do not rely 
On men’s promise of marriage
Just look at older sister Bacion
She grew her teeth and eventually lost all of them
Your mustache, Nonoy, please have it trimmed
One day it will cover your lip
If you don’t have a pair of scissors, go to the tailor
Give him your lip-you may just get a trim for free
Pitiful is the lot of the pufferfish
It was used as a bait in a bamboo and was caught by a crab
It was sold in Sugoy for twenty centavos
Martin gambled it away, Martin gambled it away
And lost everything
One, two, three
Four, five, six
Seven, eight, nine, ten
eleven , twelve, thirteen
Oh, drink, drink, pour out a drink
Like the pouring of the drinks last night
If you don’t pour out a drink
Weak will your body be
Tuba should be taken at a good time
By drinkers, by drunkards who are married
Occasionally, the family is neglected
Even the wife is not bedded
The coconut is a good tree
Tuba is taken from it’s bud
Borne on the shoulder is a hook with which to get the liquid, ay, ahay
Tuba indeed is my best friend
I don’t cry, i don’t cry
Because i have no mat to sleep on
I cry over the fact that no one sleeps beside
This body of mine which keeps turning
Like a child rolling around
I planted sioktong
Under your house I buried it
The Pepsi-Cola bore fruit, Coca-Cola
The body was Giniebra
It grew as La Tondena
Its leaves were beer
Giniebra Fiesta
Pass by, pass by
A-dancing went the bukaw
A-whistling went the bamboo tuba container
Up in the sky
It has begun, it has begun
There was tuba, but no sumsuman
Manang Pulana climbed the tuba tree
Her skirt was ripped and letters were uncovered
When I read them, they were b, o, bo, c, a, ca
When I put them together, they meant it opens and closes
The tall grasses should not be burned
Because they can enhance
Because they can enhance the conditions
The conditions, if they are favorable
Even without a mat, even without a cover above
The virtue of a woman is that her liver is outside
The virtue of a man, he has something dangling
There lies the happy thing, when they are in a skirmish
It goes in robust, it comes out feeble
The horn of the bull can be made into a machete handle
The horn of a deer is a remedy for illness
The horn of a human, even though boneless
Shaven is its head when butting horn against horn
Oh, Inday, Inday, stop swaying your hips
Because it adds, it adds to the delight
Guess
Guess now!
What part of the body
Is always wet
And is bordered by hair?
There was a jacket 
That fell off the Manila Hotel,
Where was it taken?
How does a dried fish eat?
It goes to the side, it goes to the middle
What animal is it
That has its feet on the head?
They ate the intestines, 
And threw away the body
Captain’s sword
Cannot be held
My chicken by the stream
Has a coiled beak
My fish in Marabilis
Has its scales inside
A piece of coconut meat
Crawls at night
The house of St. Anne
Has no door, has no lock
My house upstream
Has no post, has no lock
It is already so full 
But it is not even half-filled
Bilaman, bilaman
Touch it and it will die
Feel it, it is very hairy
Open it, it is very red
The woman is already crying
Still the man keeps on
Two pieces of bamboo
Can reach Bacon
When it sleeps it wears spectacles
When it walks it wears slippers
I cooked some glutinous rice
I ate all, including the pot
My house out in the sea
Has thousand posts
The virgin gave birth
And threw away the diaper
It has been delivered
But it does not live yet
I will not leave you be
Until you grow feathers
I am poet, dreamer of dreams;
No arms I bring, but poetic word
My thoughts, ideas flow like streams
But mightier far than flaming sword
I dream of genuine brotherhood
Among the poets of the world
And in my dreams for common good
I see the flag of peace unfurled
I dream and trust what writers say
The pen is mightier than the sword
So day and night I dream and pray
For peace to men through poetic word
I dream the dreams of saintly men
Peace for mankind on bended knees
I dream the dream of Bethlehem
Goodwill to men and on earth, peace
Pongpongay, pongpongay
Inday’s eyes
Open betel leaf, bird
Child, bukiki
Moved his bowels in the clearing
Was bitten by a hermit crab
He ran and ran
I went fishing in Bosing
All of us went this way
I went fishing in Busay
All of us fell backwards
What is this? Peanut
What is that? Pepper
What is that (far off)? Rock
Gentleman, my head is all white
Lady, my head is all dried up
One with dirt on the head
Will be married on Sunday
One with dirt on shoulder
Will be married to morrow
It shines, it rains
Two old people are being married
It rains, it shines
Two hairless persons are being married
It shines, it rains
Two old people are being married
The meat is full of bones
The rice is full of scabs
Rain, rain pagampan
Wash clean the road
Because the captain is coming
Rain, pagampan
Flood the street
So that the Captain can’t pass through
In the olden times
There was a cat with a deformed ear
He couldn’t be buried 
Because he was blind in one eye
Shave, shave, roasted one
The distant one i will reward
The near one i will not reward
Pricked by a sliver, pricked by a sliver, patanog
If no sound comes out of you
I’ll feed you
To the crocodile in Matnog
Cross of God
He doesn’t taken a bath
Heaven, earth
Sinner
Jesus, mary and Joseph
Let me be far from trouble
Let me be near blessing
Jesus, Mary, santikan
The flint for making fire is on his buttocks
Dominus vobiscum
Chocolate in the pot
Sipped in the morning
Wiri, wiri, wiri
No God during the day
No God at night
Thanks be to God
Ate his fill without spending
And brought home the leftover
Oh, life!
In the morning, vegetable
In the afternoon, salted shrimp fry
In the evening, taro
Whose child are you?
Juan, the Smack
Who baptized you?
Juan, the carabao
What holy water was used?
The cow’s urine
What candle was used?
The young leaf of the palm
Run
Monkey
Diridot, diridot
Goes through the buttocks
Kiyaki, kiyaki
Bitten by a house lizard
Under a balete tree
Pasine, pasiton
Paturoturayos, spurt!
Dos, dos, cassava ball
Who gets caught must suffer
Pick, pick ragoring
There are nine bamboo branches
The sideburns were exposed
And showed a tomato seed
Bangkaw, bangkaw
Who played a prank?
Woe to the turtle
He couldn’t duck
Kalabunot, kalabunot
Who passed bad wind?
Copycat
Eater of scabs
If you don’t want it, so you don’t 
Your father is a witch
Look! Embarrassed one!
Dog’s private part
Balanced himself on the coconut shredder
Danced on the stove although there was no music
Fritters, banana fritters
Flavored with chicken dung
Sitsiritsit, it’s Ta Biba
Cooked some sweets at the curve of the street
She mixed it in a bedpan
And she had a very good sale
Your handkerchief, Neneng
A hawk made off with it
Took it to Nono
Who kept on kissing it
When she tried to retrieve it
He would not give it back
Nono said, Neneng
You pay him back with kisses
Telebong, telebong, telebong!
There’s someone under the house
His name is Inton
And he’s looking for Basion
Bald pate, pagotpot
Tethered to chicken dung
Throw into the fire the blind one
Hang up the one eyed
Hit the deaf one’s head on the wall
Make a buttress of the lame one
Spaniard, spread-eagled
Has hairy legs
Chinaman, pig
Worshiping a tree
Sat on a bench
And exposed his privates
Arimunding-munding, capsule
Your buttocks are red
Paciano is one-eyed
Pacita is blind
And has a marble in her eye
Monay in Tacuban
Was hit by lightning
And could hardly be seen
Pick, pick earthen jar
Nab Benito
For he stole some sugar cane
Edad, with deformed spine
Has a padlock on her hip
Isko patingko
Fell off the bench
His penis went askew
Jose, pakasi
Went up a coconut tree
Hit with a pole on the buttocks
He folded up while he walked
Juan shell
Moved his bowels on the bank of a stream
Was bitten by a hermit crab
And he ran and ran
Juan likes taro
Even if it smells, he’ll eat it
Juan likes taro
Even if it smells, he’ll eat it
Attractive Maria
Was caught by a cricket
Was taken to heaven
And was torn to bits
Pedro, penduka
Has a long bill
Pedro, penduka
With a very long bill
Reached Manila
And was attacked by other billed birds
Sabel, broth
Goat, carabao
Sabel
Stood on the wall
And repeatedly shot at
Valentin, balingkugay
His private part is in his buttocks
Vicente, neighbors
Stale sweet yam
Put into a pot
And he was still Vicente
Felipe is a fool
Rode in an airplane
And when he was air-bone
His slippers fell
You brute
You brute
You pest
You dog
You dog
You pig
You monkey
You devil
You devil
You devil
You horned creature
You evil creature
You devil-possessed
You’re bitchy
You’re so bitchy
Your bitchy-ness
You flirt
You flirt
You’re so flirty
You’re crazy
You’re so crazy
Son of a bitch
Fucker
Fucker
Fuck you
You son of a bitch
Your mother’s vulva
Your grandmother’s vulva
You’re oversexed
Bitch
Prostitute
Fuck
Fucker
Fucked the dead
Crazy
You wild cat
You snake
You fish
You are like a bird
You wild frog
You wild cat
You monkey
You wild lizard
You carabao
You dog
You are worse than a wild pig
May you be robbed
May you be crippled
May you be eaten by the waves
May you be drowned while sailing
May you nibble your elbow
May the lightning strike you
Remember the flower
In the morning it is beautiful
But due to the extreme heat
It wilts in the afternoon
Before one can reap
He must first plant
Of what use would the fodder be
If the horse is dead?
What you sow
Is what you reap
A kind of tree
Will bear its kind of fruit
From the latundan 
Will not spring a bunguran
A guava tree will not bring forth
A lemon fruit
It is possible to pair off
A mature and a young coconut
Pretending to be a banana
When in reality, really a banana
It is a big tree
But it casts no shade
The dog that does not bark
Is prone to bite
However big the stone is
It will be worn away by water drops
It is the snail that must come to the stone
For the stone will not come to the snail
He who is afraid of locusts
Will not reap anything
Don’t expect a cat to have horns
Though it is covered well
The fish will smell if it is rotten
She took so much time choosing
And what she found was a tabige
He hitched a ride on the carabao’s back
And now he wants to control it’s horns
The one who crowed
Is the one who laid the egg
The horse will not wince
It it has no wound
The carabao wa whipped
The horse got the stripes
He derides, yet he’s a skunk
He contradicts, yet he’s a monkey
The sow will not mate
If she is not inclined
Acting like a virgin
When she’s really a pig
If fed with chicken dung
Wipe it off because of its foul odor
A fish
Is caught through its mouth
The ground has ears
The tongue has wings
One word is enough
For the wise
There is no beauty
That has no defect
Suffer it, my heart
No one asked you to do it
If a maiden falls
Though she may get up, she’ll be scratched and bruised
A father’s mark 
Is difficult to erase
Blood will drip
Where the meat is hung
Beautiful of face
But her body is full of worms
When her back is turned she looks like the virgins
When she turns around she looks like a pig
If he gets in his fist
He’ll get it in up to his elbow
Where you are tethered
There you will feed
He who relies on other people
Will go hungry
Bad company
Is like a festering sore
He who treads heavily
Will hurt his foot deeply
If you are not sure of the distance
If you jump, you will fall
He who meddles 
Is suspect
What’s the cure for forgetfulness?
One vertical and one horizontal lash
What’s the cure for forgetfulness?
A blow to the head
Where you fell
There you must rise
You’re a friend when you have something to offer
You’re an enemy when you have none
After she gave it, she took it back
The whore has skin disease
Derider
Because guilty
He who pretends to be asleep
Is difficult to waken
He pretends to help,
But is actually a thief
Saint, little saint
With an evil heart
He is playing dead
But he is actually a thief
Pretending to be demure
But really a loose woman
Hele-hele 
But she actually likes it
Pretending to be religious
But really a wanton saint
When he denies without being asked
It means he is guilty of misconduct
Don’t brag about your strength
Because you might trip and fall
He who does not listen to his parents 
Doesn’t turn out well
He who does nnot listen to advice
Encounters hard times
Batter to make a child cry when he is a baby
Than for him to make his parents cry when he grows up
Eat what is available
Don’t seek for aht is not there
Don’t depend on what is not there
Even food is lost on its way to the mouth
Breakfast is to warm the stomach
Not for indulging
Coward, coward
Brave enough only to confront the porridge
I pounded the rice, i cooked it
When cooked, someone else ate it
No one will melt
His own salt
Where the sweet is
There the ant is also
If there is abundance
There is scarcity
Waste your resources
When they run out, there is hunger
Jest with a drunken man
But not with one who has just fallen asleep
The size of the button
Is also the size of the buttonhole
Were it not for the fiesta in Sipocot
She wouldn’t be darning her clothes
If you have a sort blanket
Curl up your body
The one who holds the bag
Should not dip his hand in it
The can that gives off a loud noise
Is usually empty
It is easy to break a coconut midrib
When it is just one piece
If you laid away something
You’ll have something in time of need
Where are you going to grab support
On a post or on a weed?
He who is near the pot
Is the one who gets the soot
He is far from the fire
And yet he is pushed in
He sees the needle’s eye
But not that of the axe
The house was locked
After the thief left tthe house was propped
After the storm
The barn was closed
After the horse had escaped
He is already sleeping on a bed
He transferred to the floor
He who is misled
Ends up in the sea
The rain may miss the ground when it falls
But a mother’s word is always true
Before the sun rises
One can already discern its light
There is no shore
That does not have an opposite shore
If you are afraid to ford a stream
You won’t be able to ford a river
Inquire of those you pass on the road
So you don’t lose your way
However long the procession is
It will still end up in church
Where there is devotion
There is temptation
Hail Mary, most pure
Sinless if coming with a gift
If not, get out
He who accepts God’s suffering
Is a child of God
The parish priest for the funeral
The coadjutor for the dying
What was started in play
Has become a finished basket
Where does plenty begin
But in small amounts
Bad news
Spreads quickly
There is no inferior pen
To the one who writes well
It isn’t written yet
But already it is being read
The word has been uttered
Cannot be unsaid
Whatever the music
So the dance shall be
It doesn’t matter that we perish
As long as were piled on top of each other
Money already on the boat
And it still became stone
Don’t brag about your wealth
For even the spring dries up
Asked a proper question
He gives a mean answer
We only appreciate what is good
When it is gone
Coming from a split bamboo
Waiting for rice to come to the chicken
Naturally she will follow in the footsteps of the mother sow
He can string together a cat’s bristles
Hot enough to broil a fish
More slippery than an eel
The bunguran has ripened
His tail between his legs
He played with a turtle
When the crow turns white
Being handled like an egg
Snakes can nest in it
Making like a turtle
His blood boils
His blood will drain in anxiety
Heavy buttocks
His saliva dried up
He grew a beard waiting
The flies swarmed all over him as he waited
His spit dried up waiting 
The black of his eyes turned white
His eyes were like fish eyes
A long upper lip
A shiny upper lip
His ears became so big and wide
Plenty of ears
He’s got a mole on his feet
Work done by the feet
The era wax fell off
Has a zipper on the tummy
Using the mouth to look for something
He has a very long tongue
A tongue that has branches
A tongue that can cause a festering sore
He has several tongues
At the tip of the tongue
Salivating with pleasure
Having a long hand
His footmark goes dry
There’s someone under the house
The liver will be turned inside out
Can crinkle up the heart
Still having a running nose
Washed his hand of the matter
You can’t walk in front of him
You can’t out-step him
You cut off his step
Gentle but with pressure
No shirring on the buttocks
Taking very small steps
Though you feed him with chicken dung
Put a roof over your salt
One hen scratch, one mouthful
Though you feed him from the palm of your hand
Eating only rice and salt
Pressing salt between thumb and forefinger
Eating copra with your rice
Expands like gruel
He’s got deep pockets
Lifting his own bench
You want to be rocked in a hammock
Sitting together like the stone tripod
Sleeping at the ash stove
Prepare to feed the stairs
The spoon and eel have met
As long as he has enough energy to pull up his blanket
Made of high grade steel
Being chased by a pair of scissors
Already curled up in a basket
His license has already expired
He has something stowed away in his trunk
We don’t need any light tonight
Caused a chair bottom to give away
He’s got a long rope
The post of the town
The wire snapped
He’s missing a screw
Swimming in ankle-deep water
Not exposing it to the wind
Holding up the sky
Set fire to the high seas
The heavens may go wrong
The rain may miss the ground
Very windy
Beyond the reach of thunder
Harder than stone
Lightning may strike you
The moon is full
He’s fueled up
Though you have a priest for a brother
Let the bells ring
Though you have the christ on your breast
Though you order a Mass from a harelip carabao
When the world ends
The devil might push you off
The top has a short cord
Playing around
His paper is already wet
Of the ten words he speaks, eleven are lies
The town’s newspaper
Trying to obtain a wider piece of paper
Paint it on a living stone
He is wound up like a musical instrument
He’s got a hairy soul
He can shock a dead person back to life
Only one more fly has not signed
Shorter than a ten-cent piece lying on its face
Lying on a pile of money
His talk is sweet
From the barrio of suwa
Good luck has forgotten him
Like the flower of the road
Like a forest
Like a makahiya
Like walking on a rotten log
Like dragging bamboo branch the wrong way
Like the river carried him away
Like a jackfruit had landed on him
Like a cow
Like a pig being slaughtered
Like a mad dog
Like a dog inviting trouble
Like trying to catch an eel
Like a snake
Like a dead trout
Like a fly being shooed off
Like an ant
Like henscratches
Like a noisy bird
Like a frog thrown in water
Like a regal bird
Like a glutton cat
Like a leech
Like a fly wouldn’t dare to alight on him
Like a showy bird
Like a hungry crocodile 
Like keeping a snake for a pet
Like he was perched on the carabao’s back
Like a sleeping dragon
Like a hen attacked by its own kind
Like walking on eggs
Like a wet chick
Like a boa constrictor had spat him out
Like a carabao had stepped on him
Like a hen with curly feathers
Like an owl
Like a turtle
Like stalking a dragonfly
Like a fowl with a long neck
Like cats fighting
Like he was kicked by a horse
Like a black shellfish
Like a praying mantis
Like a crab with hollow shell, one without any delectable meat
Like a tortoise
Like the voice of a bird
Like a bat
Like an owl
Regarding someone or something like an animal
Like being pursued by a naked man
Like it was made by a foot or like the foot was used to make it
Like he had fire under his buttocks
Like packing intestines
Like his liver is being sliced off
Like they were dancing on his chest
Like a sow past menopause
Like bile
Like a glutton has licked it
Like asrdines in a can
Like fried yam or banana fritters
Like cold lard
Like he couldn’t break a cooked yam in two
Like a condemned criminal’s last meal
Like a pudding sliced in two
Like he was made to drink brine
Like wrapped in salt wrapper
Like he’s not being fed
Lily frying rice being stirred
Like ten chinamen were sucking on them
Like a sewing machine shuttle
Like an axe dropped into the water
Like being raised in status from floor to bed
Like blowing into mortar
Like walking on wire
Like a whetstone
Like the underside of the pot
Like being hacked by a left-handed person
Like a barrel
Like a dull bolo
Like being raised from floor to bed
Like strolling in the moonlight
Like asking for embers
Like holding on to the wind
Like smoke that disappeared
Like putting water into a woven basket
Like water in banka
Like being carried away by the river
Like a mudhole
Like he just came out of a mudhole
Like he’s about to ford a stream
Like the earthquake’s father
Like the eatrthquake’s voice
Like twisting sand into a rope
Like a sled
Like a pole
Like a wooden saint ready for painting
Like a soul in purgatory
Like the ecce homo
Like he came from hell
Like disgrace has descended on him
Like holy week clappers
Like a cockpit
Like chinese characters have been written on it
Like paper
Like a beloved’s mortal remains have just been taken away for burial
Like someone just died
Like there’s no death
Like he hails from gatbo
Like being bewitched
Like an ogre
Like a witch being gossiped about
Like a ghost

The parrot spoke and this is what it said:
"Don't fall in love with a young bird.
Fall in love with an old bird,
Because despite his age, he gaily flies about."
Nene, who is pretty,
Is like a doll in Las Novedades.
Whenever I hear Nene's voice,
I pine for her for a hundred years.
Nene, when you were beyond the mountain,
I could still hear your voice.
Your palm and my palm have the same lines of fate,
If we get married, there will be glory in heaven.
Oh, Nene, you are so hard-hearted,
You don't hear my pleas of love.
But remember this, there will come a time
When your mother will become my mother-in-law.
Manang Pulana went up the tuba tree,
She tore her skirt and revealed some writing.
When I read it, it said C-O Co, C-A Ca,
When I put it together, it was a book that could open and close.
Manang Pulana went fishing in a well,
A mudfish nibbled, an eel took the bait.
When the beautiful fish was finally caught
Mana said, "Oh my, how big it is!"
It was fiesta in Legaspi when I saw you.
I was in the Alacto bus, you were in a private car.
We were apart by some ten kilometers,
Bit I could still smell your body odor.
That's why I don't want to marry you,
Because I know what runs in your family.
And to prove this, last Friday noon
Your mother was seen flying with a human being under her arm.

six hours
after the midday meal
(what better clock is there than a grumbling stomach)
from the time shafts of light fell
through the parted
wall of darkness
on the matted shadows:
underneath the wharf
far from the wide-opened eyes
of eletric lights
spoken words
are lost in the embrace of the voice
of the shore's spouse,
the seashore's true mate-
it5 comes near the shore
and becomes a container
of the tales
about life by the sea
it departs and arrives
at the opposite shore
bringing the message
nobody reads
anywhere;
the water turns black
becomes murky as it pounds against
the supine wharf
becomes a voyager
a wanderer
in search of crevices
in the salty sea
like the shadows
underneath the wharf
who built their huts
against scratch of time.
among the stones resting
are the lizards.
six hours
after a midday meal
(according to the grumbling stomach)
passes
as ball-bearing feet
and arms holding on the cables
carry away the grains
spwed out by the ship
and bear on their heads the world
contained in sacks
unmindful of the groaning stomach
their dripping sweat
making up their snack.
the matted darkness, slowly-
gets peeled off by the kerosene lamp
full of soot, until it is all gone-
and then:
a four-walled space divided once
has become two,
with nipa for a roof and bamboo slats for a floor
it has become a box
with people in it and a hearth
it has become a home
here
when voices swim
in the murky waters of the river
this becomes a well of life.
underneath the wharf
even the sand which is the skin
of the dessert world becomes an oasis
for bodies that have nowhere else to go
this is the world underneath the wharf
aheltered there by darkness
are the matchbox-like huts
that wrap the warmth of human hearts
made one, or brought together
by the cloudy morning
the matchbox-like huts
that lie side by side
underneath the wharf.
among the stones
the lizards rest.
